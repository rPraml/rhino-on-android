# rhino-on-android

This is a very simple demo, if rhino works on android.

# AI disclaimer

As I am not yet very familiar with android development, this app was 95% AI generated by ChatGPT.

These prompts are used for now

- I: write a simple android app and embed mozilla rhino javascript engine to execute simple
  javascript
- ChatGPT: tells me how to install android studio and shows me some example java code
- I: hmm android studio uses kotlin
- ChatGPT: shows me some kotlin code, but this does not work

For now, I've installed android studio where I've created a new app and after a short struggle with
the windows firewall, I could successfully pair via WIFI and launch the app on the phone.

Then I asked ChatGPT:
```
I have this android code:

<whole code of existing MainActivity.kt>

How do I extend it, so that I have a textarea and a button to execute the javascript
```
which produces an almost working code.
